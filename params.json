And writing is *slow*. It's nifty for\r\nscenarios like configuration objects that get created once, and accessed many\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nRun the performance.rb script in the test directory for a gander.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4.
